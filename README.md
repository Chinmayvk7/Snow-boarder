- Custom Environments: I sculpted mountain-like structures with slopes by mastering the Sprite Renderer and editing nodes to create a dynamic and visually appealing terrain. 🏞️
  
- Dynamic Camera Work: Leveraged Cinemachine (virtual cameras) to create smooth, cinematic camera movements that truly follow the action, enhancing the player's experience. 🎥
  
- Physics Interactions: Explored the power of the Surface Effector 2D for realistic interactions on the slopes, and even implemented a player boost mechanic for an extra burst of speed! ✨
  
- Seamless Transitions: Utilized Scene Management for smooth level loading. - Invoke() method for precise delays, making the game flow effortlessly. 🔄
  
- Visual & Audio Flair: Integrated the Particle System component for cool visual effects (like snow trails!), and specifically triggered a "crash particle" effect for impact.

- On the audio front, I learned all about Audio Listener, Audio Source, and Audio Clip, applying various sound effects (SFX) to bring the game to life! 🔊💥
  
- Collision Detection: Mastered using tags for effective collision detection, ensuring the game responds accurately to different interactions.
  
- There is also an option of boost which can be achieved my pressing the UP arrow key and a brake( Slow down mechanism) can be applied by pressing the DN arrow key.
  
- Implemented flips( Forward and Backward), Have to say learning and adding physics was challenging and only the fun part was tweaking them.
  
- learned to effectively build interactive elements by combining objects with essential components like Sprite Renderer, Collider 2D, and Rigidbody 2D to define their properties and behaviors.

- Track metrics like speed, time, crashes, and flips.

- Feed them into a lightweight model or heuristic that adapts terrain or game speed in real-time.

- Adaptive Difficulty System – AI dynamically adjusts terrain difficulty and player speed based on real-time performance metrics.

-  Player Modeling – Game analyzes player crashes, speed, and control precision to maintain personalized challenge levels.
